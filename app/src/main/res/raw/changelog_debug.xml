        <changelogtext>Background jobs were migrated to a new system. You may need to toggle the settings to ensure they
            run properly. This includes app updates, library updates, and automatic backups.
        </changelogtext>
    </changelogversion>

    <changelogversion changeDate="" versionName="r1340">
        <changelogtext>A new screen for managing extensions was added. If you previously installed extensions from FDroid,
            you will have to uninstall all of them first (tap on the extension then uninstall), otherwise you won't be able
            to update them due to signature mismatch. You won't lose anything in this process as the extensions themselves
            don't store anything.

    <changelogversion changeDate="" versionName="r959">
        <changelogtext>The download manager has been rewritten and it's possible some of your downloads
            aren't recognized anymore. You may have to check your downloads folder and manually delete those.
        </changelogtext>
        <changelogtext>You can now download to any folder in your SD card.</changelogtext>
        <changelogtext>The download directory setting has been reset.</changelogtext>

    <changelogversion changeDate="" versionName="r857">
        <changelogtext>[b]Important![/b] Delete after read has been updated.
            This means the value has been reset set to disabled.
            This can be changed in Settings > Downloads
        </changelogtext>
    </changelogversion>

    <changelogversion changeDate="" versionName="r736">
        <changelogtext>[b]Important![/b] Now chapters follow the order of the sources. [b]It's required that you update your entire library
            before reading in order for them to be synced.[/b] Old behavior can be restored for a manga in the overflow menu of the chapters tab.

    <changelogversion changeDate="" versionName="r724">
        <changelogtext>Kissmanga covers may not load anymore. The only workaround is to update the details of the manga
            from the info tab, or clearing the database (the latter won't fix covers from library manga).
